/// \brief The PbiFilter class provides a mechanism for performing PBI-enabled
///        lookups.
///
/// The PbiFilter API is designed to be flexible, both built-in and for
/// client-side customization. Built-in filters are provided for common queries,
/// and client code can define and use custom filters as well. More complex
/// filtering rules can be constructed via composition of simpler child filters.
///
/// Filter objects used as children of PbiFilter need only provide a method that
/// matches this signature:
///
/// \include code/PbiFilter_Interface.txt
///
/// This requirement is enforced internally, using the PbiFilterConcept to
/// require a compatible interface without requiring inheritance. This approach
/// allows composition of heterogeneous filter types without worrying about a
/// class hierarchy, pointer ownership across library/client boundaries, etc.
///
/// Thus a client application can define a custom filter if the built-in filters
/// do not quite meet requirements. This filter may then be used in further
/// PbiFilter composition, or directly to PbiFilterQuery
///
/// \include code/PbiFilter_CustomFilter.txt
///
/// As mentioned above, complex filters can be built up using multiple "child"
/// filters. These complex filters are constructed by using either
/// PbiFilter::Union (logical-OR over all direct children) or
/// PbiFilter::Intersection (logical-AND over direct children).
